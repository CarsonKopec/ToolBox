# My Tools Repository

This repository is a collection of tools, scripts, configurations, and images for various projects, including Raspberry Pi setups, small utilities, and general experiments.

---

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into the following main folders:

### **1. Config**
Contains configuration files for different systems, applications, or projects.  
Examples include:
- `config.txt` or `cmdline.txt` for Raspberry Pi setups
- JSON or YAML configuration files for scripts or tools
- System or application settings backups

### **2. Images**
Holds images related to projects and setups.  
Examples include:
- Raspberry Pi OS images (`.img` files)
- Screenshots, diagrams, or reference images
- Visual assets used by scripts or projects

### **3. Scripts**
Contains executable scripts for automation, tools, or experiments.  
- Scripts are organized by purpose:
  - `pi/` – Scripts specifically for Raspberry Pi
  - `general/` – Miscellaneous utilities or experiments
- Typical file types: `.py`, `.sh`, `.js`

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Scripts often require a `config.json` or similar configuration file in the same directory.
- Large files (e.g., Pi images) may be tracked using **Git LFS**.
- Follow folder-specific README files (if present) for detailed instructions on using scripts or configs.

## Notes

* This repository is intended as a personal toolbox for development, experimentation, and Raspberry Pi projects.
* Keep the folder structure intact to ensure scripts and configs work correctly.
* Contributions or modifications can be added in separate subfolders to keep the repo organized.
